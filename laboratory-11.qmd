## PRE-LAB PREP

Collect approximately 1 cup of soil from a garden or farm. Make sure to sample only to a 0-3 inch depth. **Optional**: Determine the texture of your soil sample using the ribbon method and record it.

## INVESTIGATION A: Macronutrient Cycles

For this investigation, we will consider N-P-K, three essential plant macronutrients. You may recognize these letters from bags of fertilizer in the hardware store or garden centers. We have gone over the Nitrogen cycle in detail as Nitrogen is ubiquitously the most limiting nutrient for plant growth. Phosphorus and Potassium undergo their own cycles which are unique processes. The following exercise will provide an opportunity to understand the characteristics and movement of these three major macronutrients.

Fill in the following information pertaining to the nutrient cycles.

2.  How is potassium (K) availability controlled by mineral weathering?

3.  In Minnesota, what is the best time to soil test for an accurate understanding of plant available nitrogen (N)?

## INVESTIGATION B: Measuring Soil pH and Nitrate Levels with Test Strips

Below are instructions for prepping two different set ups for soil analysis using pH and nitrate strips. **Preparing them in advance will be helpful to you as they need 10 mins before reading.** We are using test strips in the lab to provide a rapid indication of the pH and nitrate in your soil sample. However, note that for making detailed decisions regarding soil management and plant growth, you would want a more accurate, laboratory measurement of pH and nitrate.

Soil pH: 1. Locate your soil (check-in with TA on duty to provide your sample to you), 50 ml tube, DI water, pH strips. 2. Fill the 50 ml tube with 10 ml of your soil. 3. Saturate the soil with DI water and fill up to the 20 mL line. This makes a 1:1 ratio of soil/water. 4. Shake vigorously for roughly 30 sec and let sit for 10 mins. 5. When ready to read, take a pH strip and dip into the tube. Try not to dip directly in the soil. 6. The pH paper will react; line it up with the color chart to what closely matches the strip. Record your result.

Nitrate: 1. Locate your soil (soil from same sample as for your pH reading), filter paper, funnel, catch receptacle, DI water, nitrate strip. 2. Fold the filter paper into a cone shape. You can do this by folding it in half and then in half once more (making it into a quarter). Open the filter up to make a cone shape and place it in a funnel. 3. Pre wet the paper by squirting DI water around it. It doesn't need to be saturated but wetting it will help the filtering go faster. 4. Put a scoop of your soil (approximately one spoonful/scoop) into the filter and add water to the top of the filter line. It is very important that no soil overflows into the catch. It will make reading your result difficult. 5. Allow to sit for \~10 mins. 6. Use the bottom square of the nitrate strip to read result. It is very important that no soil gets on the strip, as you will not be able to see the color otherwise. Dip the strip into the clear liquid, wait 30 sec and record the range.

## INVESTIGATION C: Soil pH and Nutrient Availability

Recall soil pH has a profound impact on plant uptake of nutrients. Soils which are too acidic and too basic will result in difficulty accessing certain nutrients for plants. Use the nutrient availability diagram to identify ideal pH ranges for each plant nutrient.

## INVESTIGATION D: Liming and Base Saturation

In the field, quick lime or elemental sulfur is used to adjust pH to a desired range. The following investigation demonstrates a soil with low base saturation (Low B.S.) and a soil with high base saturation (High B.S.) combined with two different amendments. The diagram shows six variations of soil + solution and the pH for each sample. We used HCl in place of elemental sulfur.
Before recoding the diagram provided in lab, answer the following questions.

How do you think the quick lime will impact the Low B.S. sample?
 
How will the addition of acid affect the pH in soil with High B.S.?

**Record the pH of each solution here.**

## INVESTIGATION E: Observation of Plant Nutrient Deficiencies

Nutrient deficiencies in plants can sometimes have complex causes and symptoms, and can also be related to drought and other types of stress. Just having a sufficient total amount of an element in the soil does not always eliminate deficiencies because plant nutrient uptake is dependent on a wide range of factors including nutrient form, mobility, and soil properties such as pH, mineralogy, and organic matter. Nutrient deficiencies can be outwardly manifested in different ways in different plant species, and the symptoms of some nutrient deficiencies can mimic other forms of stress. However, experts with enough experience can diagnose nutrient deficiencies in the field. In this investigation, you will examine the outward effect of N, P and K deficiencies in corn. Note that symptoms in other plant species may look similar or may vary, depending on biology and growth conditions.

Observe and read through examples of nutrient deficiencies in corn. Then, look at the unknown corn plants with nutrient deficiencies and determine which particular nutrient is most likely deficient in each case.

## INVESTIGATION F: Common Fertilizer Materials

**Inorganic Fertilizers**
Plant roots absorb the majority of their nutrients from the soil solution as simple, inorganic ions (charged atoms or molecules). Larger molecules can also be absorbed, but their rate of absorption is slow. Most inorganic fertilizers dissolve readily in water and are immediately available to plants for uptake. When used according to recommendations, these types of fertilizers efficiently supply the required nutrients for plant growth and are safe for the environment. However, excessive rates can injure plant roots due to high salts and potentially lead to environmental degradation. 

Review the inorganic fertilizers and complete the following table.

```

**Organic Fertilizers**
Organic fertilizers are comprised of a diverse mixture of organic molecules and usually contain more complex chemical substances that take time to be broken down into forms usable by plants. These are usually considered slow-release type fertilizers, compared to the quick-release characteristics of most inorganic fertilizers. It is important to apply these organic fertilizers well before periods of rapid plant growth. Organic fertilizers usually have a low salt index, so larger amounts can be applied at one time without causing injury to plant roots. With organic nitrogen sources (except urea), one application can be made without having to be concerned about losing most of the nitrogen to leaching. However, even organic fertilizers applied at excessive rates can cause environmental degradation due to nitrate leaching or runoff of soluble organic compounds. The cost of organic fertilizers at garden centers on a per-pound of nutrient basis is usually higher than quick-release inorganic fertilizers. Manure, compost, and many other materials used as organic fertilizers add considerable quantities of organic matter to the soil. Organic matter can increase soil drainage, aeration, water holding capacity, and the ability of the soil to hold nutrients. The beneficial effects of organic matter on soil structure can have a greater effect on plant growth than the fertilizer value of some of these organic materials. Most organic fertilizers also provide a variety of macronutrients (besides NPK) as well as many micronutrients.

## INVESTIGATION G: Reading and Using a Soil Test Report

Soil testing is a useful nutrient management tool. If used in a predictive mode, a soil test can reduce the environmental risks from the addition of nutrients to the soil while optimizing plant growth. There are two soil reports from the soil we observed in the field last week on the bench. One has soil test results and recommendations for a lawn and garden, while the other report is for future farm and field planting. Fill in the following table of each soil test. Note that recommendations are in P2O5 and K2O, so there is no need to convert. Use the farm and field report to make a recommendation for planting corn or grain.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(huxtable)
library(dplyr)

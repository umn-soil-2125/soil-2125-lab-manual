    "text": "1.1 INVESTIGATION A: Using a Hydrometer to Determine Particle Size\nParticle size distribution has become a standard means for characterizing and classifying the fine earth fraction of solid soil particles, and is used to determine the soil texture class. This experiment uses a Bouyoucos hydrometer to measure the density (grams per L) of a liquid mixture (“slurry”) of soil and water.\nUsing the hydrometer allows us to determine soil texture by measuring the grams of the soil particles (sand, silt, and, clay) that remain suspended in the cylinder after a specific period of time. Different sized soil particles are separated by their different sedimentation rates – e.g. larger particles will settle faster in a column of water, while smaller particles remain suspended much longer in the solution (based on Stokes Law).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this video before you start Investigation A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Preparation\nThe two cylinders in this investigation each contain 60 grams of oven-dry dispersed soil – one soil is from an E horizon and one is from a B horizon. After mixing thoroughly with a stir stick, the largest particles (sand) will quickly drop to the bottom of the cylinder. After 40 seconds, only silt and clay particles are left suspended in the water. After two hours, only clay-sized particles remain.\n\n\n1.1.2 Measurements\n40 Second Measurement\n\nCarefully use the stirring rod (approximately 18 inches long with a disk on the end) to completely disperse the soil in the cylinder. This requires that you slowly lower and lift the stirring rod up and down in the cylinder until all the sediment is removed from the bottom of the cylinder.\nAfter stirring, immediately note the time to the nearest second. Carefully and slowly insert the hydrometer (the hydrometers are extremely fragile) into the cylinder. Please refer to the figure on page 2. Note: you may need to use your finger to stop the hydrometer from bobbing.\nAfter 40 seconds, read the number (at liquid level) on the hydrometer.\nThis reading must be corrected for temperature. Add 0.4 g/L for each degree above 20ºCelcius or subtract 0.4 g/L for each degree below 20ºCelcius.\n\n2 Hour Measurement\n\nDue to time constraints, two hour readings will be provided in lab.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Hydrometer Process\n\n\n(Note: The soil in the diagram has (60-30)/60 x 100= 50% Sand; 10/60 x100= 17% Clay; 100-50-17=33% Silt)\nCalculations: correct readings before calculating sand, silt, and clay!\n\\[\nSand (\\%) = \\frac{M_{sample,ovendry} - 40s\\ reading}{M_{sample,ovendry}} x 100%\n\\]\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements\nSample 1\nSample 2\n\n\nSample mass (oven-dry)\n60 g\n60 g\n\n\n40s reading (uncorrected\ng/L\ng/L\n\n\nTemperature (C)\nºC\nºC\n\n\n40s reading (corrected)\ng/L\ng/L\n\n\n% Sand\n%\n%\n\n\n2hr reading (uncorrected)\ng/L\ng/L\n\n\nTemperature @2hr (C)\nºC\nºC\n\n\n2hr readng (corrected)\ng/L\ng/L\n\n\n% Clay\n%\n%\n\n\n% Silt\n%\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nSample 1\nSample 2\n\n\n% sand\n\n\n\n\n% silt\n\n\n\n\n% clay"

Clay percentages are read along the lines from left to right across the triangle. Silt is read along the lines from the upper right to lower left. Sand along the lines from lower right to the upper left portion of the triangle. The intersections of the three sides on the triangle give the texture class name.

    "text": "1.3 INVESTIGATION C: Texturing Soil with the “Feel” Method\nDetermining texture by feel takes practice (professional soil scientists can texture soil by feel and determine the texture within five percent clay content!). The following table, chart provided in lab, and text will help you learn how to texture by feel.\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture\nFeel\n\n\nCoarse sand\nFeels sharp, rasping, gritty, individual grains easily distinguished.\n\n\nFine sand\nGritty but very fine. Individual grains only just visible. Rasping sound between finger and thumb heard when placed close to the ear.\n\n\nSilt\nDry pellets will crush between the fingers, yielding a floury dust with a smooth silky feel. When wet, the silkiness persists and the cast is slightly plastic (not\nvery sticky). Particles are not quite visible to the naked eye.\n\n\nClay\nDry pellets feel very hard, and it is difficult or impossible to crush them between the finger and thumb. When moistened, it is very sticky (plastic-like consistency).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWATCH VIDEO TUTORIAL ON IPADS!\n\nTo determine the soil texture by feel, the soil must be moistened. Add a small amount of water to the soil if needed to give it a putty-like (play-doh) consistency. Not too wet - not too dry!\nForm the soil into a ball.\nTry to push the soil between your thumb and forefinger to make a “ribbon” ~ 2mm thick; the longer the ribbon, the more clay there is in the soil.\nMove the soil between your thumb and forefinger to determine if the soil feels really gritty, really smooth, or somewhere in between. Sand feels gritty, silt feels smooth, clay feels sticky (allows you to form ribbons).\nUse the provided flow chart and suggested order below to assist in calibrating yourself.\n\nPracticing – WASH YOUR HANDS BETWEEN EVERY SAMPLE!!!!!!! Use the known texture samples to practice texturing soil with the “feel” method.\nHere is a suggested method of practicing (Nic’s method to the madness):\n\nStart with the silt loam – you should be able to make a ribbon, but &lt; 1”\nMove to the silty clay loam – you should notice that you can get a longer ribbon, 1-2”\nMove to the silty clay – you should be able to get an even longer ribbon, &gt; 2”\nIn these three samples, you kept increasing clay content while decreasing sand content.\nNow try the loam – you should notice that it feels like there is more sand in it than in the silt loam, silty clay loam and silty clay, but it doesn’t feel really gritty. The loam texture class should feel like equal proportions of sand, silt and clay. You should be able to make a ribbon, but &lt; 1”.\nMove to the loamy sand. This should feel much grittier and you shouldn’t be able to make a ribbon. However, the soil should form a ball without being excessively wet.\nFinally move to the sand. This should feel extremely gritty and you shouldn’t be able to make a ribbon. You need to get sands excessively wet in order make a ball out of them.\nLastly, try moving from the loam to the clay loam and finally the clay. You should feel a clay increase similar to the silt loam to silty clay loam to silty clay samples, but since these all have more sand, they should feel less smooth and more like a mixture of the particle size classes.\n\nNote: Check one box to choose between the characteristics (gritty, smooth, or gritty/smooth). For ribbon length, choose between short (&lt;1”), medium (1-2”), or long (&gt;2”).\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture\nDominated by gritty feel\nDominated by smooth feel\nEqually gritty/smooth\nRibbon length\n\n\nSilt Loam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilty Clay Loam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilty Clay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoamy Sand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClay Loam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture the following unknown soils and complete the table.\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture\nDominated by gritty feel\nDominated by smooth feel\nEqually gritty/smooth\nRibbon length\nTextural Class Name\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC"

The soil core method is the most commonly utilized method and the one you should be the most familiar with, given appropriate information on a test. The clod method and graduated cylinder method are done in this lab purely to demonstrate other ways to determine the bulk density of soil materials.\n\n3.1.1 1. Bulk Density: Clod Method\n\\[\nD_{b,clod}=\\frac{(weight\\ of\\ clod\\ in\\ air)\\ g}{(weight\\ of\\ clod\\ in\\ air\\ -\\ weight\\ of\\ clod\\ in\\ water)\\ g*1cm^{3}/1g}\n\\] Bulk density is defined as mass (oven dry weight) divided by total volume. Measuring the mass of the clod is straightforward; measuring the volume is not. We can use Archimedes’ Principle to measure the volume of any solid, regardless of its shape. Simply stated, if a 50g clod weighs 20g when immersed in water, it must have displaced 30g of water. Since 1 cm3 of water weighs 1 gram, the 30g of water is equivalent to 30 cm3 of water. The volume of the clod, therefore, is 30 cm3. A general mathematical expression for the above statement is:\nVolume of clod (in cm3) = [(weight of clod in air) – (weight of clod in water)] g × 1cm3/1 g\nThis formula represents the denominator in the Dbclod formula above, giving the result of your calculation in units of g/cm3 (also written as g cm-3), which is bulk density.\nWATCH VIDEO TUTORIAL ON IPADS!!\n\nTake one clod from the counter, a small tag will be attached indicating the clod ID (take note of this when filling out the chart on page 2).\nMeasure the weight of the clod in air by attaching the paperclip to the hook hanging from the bottom of the scale.

Ask a TA for help if you need any assistance.\nPlace the water bucket beneath the clod, allowing it to be submerged in the water while hanging from the paper clip and take the weight a second time.

For finer-textured soils this does not work very well because air gets trapped in very small pores.\n\\[\nPorosity(P)_{direct}=\\frac{(volume\\ of\\ all\\ pores)\\ cm^{3}}{(total\\ volume\\ of\\ soil)\\ cm^{3}}\\ *\\ 100%\n\\]\n\nFill a 100 ml graduated cylinder to the 100 ml mark with tap water. Tilt the beaker with the fine sandy soil (from Investigation A, Method 2) to a 15˚ angle. Pour the water very slowly into the soil-filled beaker until the water is just at the surface of the soil. The soil surface should glisten. Be very careful not to stir or shake the soil in the beaker.\nLet the soil stand for several minutes until all of the water soaks into the very small pores. After the water soaks in, add a little more water. Repeat this step as necessary.\nDetermine the amount of water used to fill the pore space in the 100 cm3 of soil by subtracting the volume of water in the graduated cylinder from the original 100 ml volume. Note: We are assuming that the water poured into the soil exactly filled the pore space and thus equals the total pore volume.\nDispose of wet soil in the bucket labeled “For Wet Soil Only”\nRecord your results in the table below and make the necessary calculations.\nRinse the beaker in the bucket provided and wipe it out with a towel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements\n\n\nInitial volume of water\n100 mL\n\n\nVolume of water remaining in cylinder after all soil pores are filled\nmL\n\n\nVolume of water filling soil pores (initial – remaining)\nmL\n\n\nTotal volume of soil (1 cm3 = 1 ml)\n100 mL\n\n\nPorosity = (volume of water filling pores / total volume) × 100%\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 2. Soil Porosity: Indirect Method\nThis method uses bulk density and particle density to determine porosity (percent pore space). Most mineral soils have a particle density of about 2.6 to 2.7 grams/cm3. For this exercise, assume a particle density of 2.65 g/cm3 (the same density as quartz, a major constituent of mineral soils).\n\\[\nPorosity(P)_{indirect} =\\ ({1 - (\\frac{(D_{b}\\ by\\ graduated\\ cylinder\\ method)\\ \\frac{g}{cm^{3}}}{(particle\\ density)\\ \\frac{g}{cm^{3}}})})\\ *\\ 100%\n\\]\nDepending on accuracy in collecting your porosity data, your calculations of porosity by the direct method and the indirect method should be similar. Record your results.\nDirect method:\n\nIndirect method:"

What “tale” did we talk about in class (see the end of lecture 1.8 – soil pH) that would account for these differences?\n\n   \n\nSodium carbonate salts (Na2CO3) are more soluble than calcium carbonate salts (CaCO3). This means that when sodium carbonates are dissolved, more OH- is released. Sodium carbonates also increase Na+ concentrations. Both soil 7 and 8 are saline, but differ in their sodicity status and pH. Briefly explain how the different solubilities of Na and Ca carbonate salts mean that sodic soils would be (1) found in drier climates and (2) have higher pHs than other non-sodic (but still saline) soils."

The tensiometer is essentially a water column with a porous ceramic tip at the bottom. The pores in the ceramic are so small that water will not move through the ceramic under the influence of gravity alone (i.e. the force of gravity does not pull down hard enough for the water to move through). However, you now know that due to adhesion, cohesion, and capillary action that soils can exert a tension on water and pull it against gravity. The vacuum gauge readings show the relative amount of tension that the soil is exerting on the water.\nTo make the gauges reasonable for the general public to use, scales are usually from 0-100 in positive numbers – a high reading on the gauge is caused by a dry soil that has a high tension. Note that this is different than what we discussed in lecture in that the values are positive rather than negative – these are designed for consumer use and are scaled and calibrated based on convenient numbers, not fundamental principles, but the concepts are exactly the same. These types of tensiometers are commonly used for irrigation scheduling to let the land managers know when to turn on the sprinklers, such as at a golf course.\nRead the tension gauge. The units are in centibars of tension (if you put a negative in front of the number and divide by 100, you would have “bars” of tension as we discussed in class). Note how it has changed since the start of the week for each soil. Mark the current gauge reading and time on the graph so we can chart the changes throughout the week.\nTensiometer Readings:\nLoamy Sand: _____________                                Silt Loam: _____________"

These zones are formed when the soil is saturated for a period of time (the iron oxides (Fe3+) coating the mineral grains are reduced by anaerobic bacteria which use the Fe3+ as an electron acceptor, reducing it to Fe2+, which is colorless, soluble and mobile in the soil solution). If the soil is then dried out during a drier part of the year, the iron reoxidizes into concentrations, but the zones in between the concentrations where the Fe was depleted will still appear grey because they won’t have iron oxide coatings.\nBecause redoximorphic features only form where the soil is saturated for a significant period of time during the year, when we see them in a soil profile, they give us a record of the highest depth that the soil is saturated at throughout the year. For this reason, redoximorphic features play a large role in field determinations of septic system design as well as wetland delineation.\nTherefore, in general, well-drained (aerobic) soils will have continuous coatings of iron-oxides on all the mineral grains and will appear the typical Fe-oxide colors throughout (brown, red, orange, yellow), while poorly drained soils will exhibit redoximorphic features in the form of iron concentrations and depletions (mottles), or a completely grey color if iron has been reduced (solubilized) and removed by moving groundwater.\n\nBased on the colors you see in the poorly drained mini-monolith, what is the depth (measured from the soil surface) that the soil is saturated to at some point during the year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n1 cm on the mini-monolith = 3 cm in the actual soil it was taken from; so multiply your depth measurement on the mini-monolith x 3 to get the actual depth."

    "section": "8.1 INVESTIGATION A: Mineral Identification",
    "text": "8.1 INVESTIGATION A: Mineral Identification\nMinerals, even of the same type, can vary in color and physical properties making visual identification challenging. Some of the most common and important primary soil minerals are quartz, orthoclase (feldspar), micas (biotite and muscovite), apatite, and calcite, and amphiboles/pyroxenes. Common iron-containing soil minerals are goethite and hematite. Check each one off as you read the description and examine the specimen provided.\nPRIMARY MINERALS are formed from the original crystallization and solidification of magma). These minerals are present in igneous rocks and can be present in sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks if they survive the weathering process (sedimentary) or increased heat and pressure (metamorphic).\n□ Quartz is a framework silicate mineral (composed almost entirely of SiO2) that is very common in soils. It is fairly easy to recognize. It is usually colorless, transparent to translucent, and often is slightly “frosted.” It is generally spherical in shape but may appear as chips or flakes. Quartz is highly resistant to weathering, which accounts for its predominance in the sand fraction of most soils and as the major component of many sand beaches.\n□ Orthoclase (KAlSi3O8) is an important member of the Feldspar family. It is also known as potassium feldspar and is a good source of potassium in the soil. The Feldspars are also framework silicates and are more susceptible to weathering than quartz because they contain other elements in the framework (K, Ca, Na) besides Si that form less stable bonds with O. Feldspar color varies from pink to grey depending on elemental composition.\n□ Mica is an important primary phyllosilicate that is found primarily in two forms: biotite and muscovite. Biotite is dark brown to black iron-rich mica which is susceptible to weathering, while muscovite is generally colorless or lightly tinted. Note the iridescence. They both consist of thin flexible sheets that tend to separate into smaller sheets or flakes. Muscovite is named after the Principality of Moscow in Russia, where it is found in large sheets and was (believe it or not) used as a glass alternative in windows centuries ago.\n□ Apatite is actually the name of a group of calcium phosphate minerals that vary slightly in composition. Apatite is present at low concentrations in many igneous rocks and can also be formed as secondary minerals in sedimentary rocks. The most common form is fluorapatite, (Ca5PO4)3F. The color of apatite varies. As apatite weathers, it releases phosphorus and calcium into the soil. Large deposits are an important source of commercial phosphorus fertilizer.\n□ Amphiboles/Pyroxenes (Magnesium/Iron-rich Silicates) are examples of Magnesium and Iron-rich silicate minerals (present primarily in Basalt) that are usually highly susceptible to weathering and therefore only present as primary minerals in some soils. They tend to be dark in color, unlike quartz, feldspar and the phyllosilicates, which are grey to colorless.\nSECONDARY MINERALS are formed in the process of weathering and transformation of primary minerals. They are present only in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.\n□ Illites, Vermiculite/Smectite, and Kaolinite are the other phyllosilicate groups that are not present in igneous rocks but are a major constituent of the clay fraction of soils. Illite is the term used for secondary micas found in the clay fraction of soils. Vermiculites and Smectites have shrink/swell properties and are formed from the weathering of micas and illites. Kaolinite is very stable and resistant to weathering (no isomorphous substitution, so no charge imbalance = a stable structure) and formed from the weathering of the other phyllosilicates.\n□ Calcite (CaCO3) occurs in limestone or similarly as dolomite (Ca,Mg)CO3 in sedimentary rocks (it can be precipitated from ocean water by organisms such as Foraminifera and corals). It can also be precipitated in arid regions where soil water containing ions and carbonates is drawn to the surface and evaporated, leaving carbonate salt residues. It often appears slightly chalky and white, whether as consolidated rock or as small nodules in the soils of dry regions. Their presence in soils can buffer soil pH from the effects of acid producing processes. It is used as an amendment to raise pH.\n□ Goethite (FeOOH) (pronounced GUR-tite) is an oxidized iron mineral (iron oxide) that gives many Minnesota soils their brown color. In soils, it is found mostly as thin coatings on soil particles. Goethite is often a secondary mineral, meaning that it forms through the weathering of other primary minerals such as basalt. The example given is from a large geologic deposit of Goethite – we would never observe such a large accumulation of pure Goethite in soils.\n□ Hematite (Fe2O3) is another iron oxide mineral that gives other Minnesota soils a reddish color, especially those in northeast Minnesota. Hematite is the iron oxide mineral that made the Iron Range of Minnesota famous. Like goethite, it is found as thin coatings on soil particles. The example given is from a large geologic deposit of Hematite – we would never observe such a large accumulation of pure Hematite in soils."

    "text": "8.4 INVESTIGATION D1: Physical Weathering\nPhysical weathering involves mechanical processes by which rocks exposed to weathering break down into smaller rocks or to their constituent minerals. Smaller rocks and particles are more susceptible to chemical weathering. Note that some sources of physical weathering can also be involved in chemical weathering.\n\nAbrasion: Water carrying suspended rock fragments has a scouring action on surfaces. Examples are the grinding action of glaciers, gravel, pebbles and boulders moved along and constantly abraded by fast-flowing streams. Particles carried by wind also have a “sand-blasting” effect.\nWetting and drying: Water penetrates into rocks and reacts with their constituent minerals resulting in recrystallization and increased stress. Wetting and drying is sometimes accompanied by shrinking and swelling, which also increasing internal stress.\nFreezing and thawing: When water is trapped in the rock (or in cracks) repeated freezing and thawing results in forces of expansion and contraction (when water freezes, its volume increases by about 9%).\nHeating and cooling: Each different mineral in the rock will expand and contract by a different amount and at a different rate with surface-temperature fluctuations. With time, the stresses produced are sufficient to weaken the bonds along grain boundaries resulting in flaking off of rock fragments at the rock’s surface.\nUnloading/Exfoliation: Many rocks are formed at great depth under intense temperatures and pressures.

    "text": "8.5 INVESTIGATION D2: Chemical Weathering\nChemical weathering involves chemical processes by which rocks and minerals exposed to the weather undergo changes in composition or crystallinity, or are removed from the rock.\n\nHydration: Ions have the tendency to attract water molecules (hydrate) and dissociate when water is present. This kind of weathering happens in arid environments where salts are present.\nHydrolysis: Water molecules at the rock’s mineral surface dissociate into H+ and OH- and the mobile H+ ions penetrate the rock’s crystal lattice. This creates a charge imbalance that causes cations (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+) to diffuse out.\nOxidation-Reduction: Several primary minerals contain Fe2+ and Mn2+. In an oxidizing environment, Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+. The change in oxidation state changes the size of the ion resulting in internal stresses and accelerated weathering. Reduced iron (Fe2+) is soluble and can be removed from the rock or mineral, while oxidized iron (Fe3+) is insoluble and remains in place.\nDissolution: Occurs when the component minerals of rocks are dissolved by water. The dissolved material is transported away leaving a space in the rock.\nAcidification: Dissolving of calcium carbonate (limestone) in acidic groundwater. One consequence of this process is the formation of caves in limestone areas.\n\nObserve the examples of chemical weathering then complete the table below.

The hotter and more humid a climate, the faster and more completely it is going to weather into soil. If a climate is cool and or dry, the weathering process proceeds more slowly. Below are temperature and precipitation maps for Minnesota. The difference in temperature will not change the weathering of rocks in Minnesota. However, the precipitation and temperature together will influence the leaching and horizon formation. Calcium carbonate will occur closer to the surface in soils with less leaching as in western Minnesota. NOTE: The diagram below shows the general pattern but DOES NOT correspond to the exact depth of leaching for any one particular profile.\n\nMatch each soil profile with its location in Minnesota by the depth to CaCO3 (Bk or Ck).

The names for these orders relate to Greek, Latin, or other root words that reveal something about the soil. Fifty-four suborders are recognized at the next level of classification. There are over 200 great groups and more than 1,100 subgroups. Soil families have similar physical and chemical properties that affect their response to management. The lowest category – soil series – is usually named after a geographic feature in the region in which it was originally found and described.

Preparing them in advance will be helpful to you as they need 10 mins before reading. We are using test strips in the lab to provide a rapid indication of the pH and nitrate in your soil sample. However, note that for making detailed decisions regarding soil management and plant growth, you would want a more accurate, laboratory measurement of pH and nitrate.\nSoil pH\n\nLocate your soil (check-in with TA on duty to provide your sample to you), 50 ml tube, DI water, pH strips.\nFill the 50 ml tube with 10 ml of your soil.\nSaturate the soil with DI water and fill up to the 20 mL line. This makes a 1:1 ratio of soil/water.\nShake vigorously for roughly 30 sec and let sit for 10 mins.\nWhen ready to read, take a pH strip and dip into the tube. Try not to dip directly in the soil.\nThe pH paper will react; line it up with the color chart to what closely matches the strip. Record your result.\n\nNitrate\n\nLocate your soil (soil from same sample as for your pH reading), filter paper, funnel, catch receptacle, DI water, nitrate strip.\nFold the filter paper into a cone shape. You can do this by folding it in half and then in half once more (making it into a quarter). Open the filter up to make a cone shape and place it in a funnel.\nPre wet the paper by squirting DI water around it. It doesn’t need to be saturated but wetting it will help the filtering go faster.\nPut a scoop of your soil (approximately one spoonful/scoop) into the filter and add water to the top of the filter line. It is very important that no soil overflows into the catch. It will make reading your result difficult.\nAllow to sit for ~10 mins.\nUse the bottom square of the nitrate strip to read result. It is very important that no soil gets on the strip, as you will not be able to see the color otherwise. Dip the strip into the clear liquid, wait 30 sec and record the range.\n\nEstimated Nitrate-Nitrogen (NO3 – N) in lbs /acre formula below.\nNote that “NO3 – N” does not mean subtract a value for N from a value for NO3; it just refers to the form of nitrogen, which is nitrate. It is pronounced as “nitrate nitrogen” and is one value - the value given by the test strip.\nAssume a bulk density of 1. Refer to the Pre-Lab Prep for depth.\n\\[\nNO\\ {3}-N\\ (lbs/ac) = \\frac{(ppm\\ extract\\ NO_{3}-N)\\ *\\ (depth\\ of\\ soil\\ sampled\\ in\\ cm)\\ *\\ (bulk\\ density)\\ *\\ 0.89}{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximate Soil pH\nApproximate Soil Nitrate (ppm)\nApproximate Soil Nitrate (lbs/acre)"

Larger molecules can also be absorbed, but their rate of absorption is slow. Most inorganic fertilizers dissolve readily in water and are immediately available to plants for uptake. When used according to recommendations, these types of fertilizers efficiently supply the required nutrients for plant growth and are safe for the environment. However, excessive rates can injure plant roots due to high salts and potentially lead to environmental degradation.\nReview the inorganic fertilizers and complete the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\nName of Inorganic Fertilizer\nAnalysis (Grade)\n\n\nAmmonium nitrate\n\n\n\nUrea\n\n\n\nTriple super phosphate\n\n\n\nMonoammonium phosphate\n\n\n\nDiammonium phosphate\n\n\n\nPotassium chloride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganic Fertilizers\nOrganic fertilizers are comprised of a diverse mixture of organic molecules and usually contain more complex chemical substances that take time to be broken down into forms usable by plants. These are usually considered slow-release type fertilizers, compared to the quick-release characteristics of most inorganic fertilizers. It is important to apply these organic fertilizers well before periods of rapid plant growth. Organic fertilizers usually have a low salt index, so larger amounts can be applied at one time without causing injury to plant roots. With organic nitrogen sources (except urea), one application can be made without having to be concerned about losing most of the nitrogen to leaching. However, even organic fertilizers applied at excessive rates can cause environmental degradation due to nitrate leaching or runoff of soluble organic compounds. The cost of organic fertilizers at garden centers on a per-pound of nutrient basis is usually higher than quick-release inorganic fertilizers. Manure, compost, and many other materials used as organic fertilizers add considerable quantities of organic matter to the soil. Organic matter can increase soil drainage, aeration, water holding capacity, and the ability of the soil to hold nutrients. The beneficial effects of organic matter on soil structure can have a greater effect on plant growth than the fertilizer value of some of these organic materials. Most organic fertilizers also provide a variety of macronutrients (besides NPK) as well as many micronutrients.\n\n\n\n\n\nName of Organic Fertilizer\nTypical Analysis (Grade)- can be variable!\n\n\nDairy cattle manure\n2-0-2\n\n\nSheep Manure\n2-1-2\n\n\nPoultry manure\n4-3-2\n\n\nSeaweed\n0-0-1\n\n\nFish meal\n10-6-0\n\n\nSewage sludge\n2-3-0\n\n\nBone meal\n1-12-0\n\n\nMilorganite\n6-3-0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete the table below.

Measure the slope length on the plaster model by placing a ruler between the black lines on the laminated plastic marker at each location. Measure to the nearest 1/16 inch. Record your measurement in Table 2 below.\n     b. Convert the measurement from Step 1 to feet. Multiply your measurement obtained in Step 1 using the horizontal scale factor (1:1,520), then divide by 12. Do this at each sampling location. Record your result in Table 2 below.\n     c. Read the slope in degrees off the dial on the side of the clinometer (Figure 1) at each sampling location on the plaster model (the white lines). Some of the sampling sites on the model are not are not flat so the clinometer will tend to rock back and forth. Try to average the variation by finding a middle point. Record your reading in Table 2.\n     d. Divide the measured slope obtained in Step 3c by 2 to correct for the vertical exaggeration of the model. For example, if you obtain a clinometer reading of 16° on the model, the corrected slope is 8° (16° ÷ 2 = 8°). Record your calculation in Table 2.\n     e. Using the Extended LS Factor Table on the next page, find the slope in degrees in Column 1 corresponding to the corrected value obtained in Step 3d. Record the corresponding slope in percent from Column 2 in Table 2. You will need percent slope to determine P. f. Continue moving across the row to the column that corresponds to the slope length in feet found in Step 3b and read the LS factor from the body of the table. There is no need to interpolate. Record the LS factor in Tables 1 and 2.\n\nC and P are found in the corresponding tables in Investigation D (last page of book).

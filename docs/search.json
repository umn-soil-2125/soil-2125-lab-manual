    "text": "1.1 INVESTIGATION A: Using a Hydrometer to Determine Particle Size\nParticle size distribution has become a standard means for characterizing and classifying the fine earth fraction of solid soil particles, and is used to determine the soil texture class. This experiment uses a Bouyoucos hydrometer to measure the density (grams per L) of a liquid mixture (“slurry”) of soil and water.\nUsing the hydrometer allows us to determine soil texture by measuring the grams of the soil particles (sand, silt, and, clay) that remain suspended in the cylinder after a specific period of time. Different sized soil particles are separated by their different sedimentation rates – e.g. larger particles will settle faster in a column of water, while smaller particles remain suspended much longer in the solution (based on Stokes Law).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this video before you start Investigation A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Preparation\nThe two cylinders in this investigation each contain 60 grams of oven-dry dispersed soil – one soil is from an E horizon and one is from a B horizon. After mixing thoroughly with a stir stick, the largest particles (sand) will quickly drop to the bottom of the cylinder. After 40 seconds, only silt and clay particles are left suspended in the water. After two hours only clay-sized particles remain.\nExample of a citation Knuth (1984). testing inline citation (Knuth 1984).\n\n\n1.1.2 Measurements\n\n1.1.2.1 40 Second Measurement\n\nCarefully use the stirring rod (approximately 18 inches long with a disk on the end) to completely disperse the soil in the cylinder. This requires that you slowly lower and lift the stirring rod up and down in the cylinder until all the sediment is removed from the bottom of the cylinder.\nAfter stirring, immediately note the time to the nearest second. Carefully and slowly insert the hydrometer (the hydrometers are extremely fragile) into the cylinder. Please refer to the figure on page 2. Note: you may need to use your finger to stop the hydrometer from bobbing.\nAfter 40 seconds, read the number (at liquid level) on the hydrometer.\nThis reading must be corrected for temperature. Add 0.4 g/L for each degree above 20ºCelcius or subtract 0.4 g/L for each degree below 20ºCelcius.\n\n\n\n1.1.2.2 2 Hour Measurement\n\nDue to time constraints, two hour readings will be provided in lab.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Hydrometer Process\n\n\n(Note: The soil in the diagram has (60-30)/60 x 100= 50% Sand; 10/60 x100= 17% Clay; 100-50-17=33% Silt)\n\n\n1.1.2.3 Calculations - note: correct readings before calculating sand, silt, and clay!\n\\[\nSand (\\%) = \\frac{M_{sample,ovendry} - 40s reading}{M_{sample,ovendry}} x 100%\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2.4 Results\nnote just trying to cut out tables to see if that works\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurementsSample 1Sample 2\n\nSample mass (oven-dry)60 g60 g\n\n40s reading (uncorrectedg/Lg/L\n\nTemperature (C)g/Lg/L\n\n40s reading (corrected)CC\n\n% Sand%%\n\n2hr reading (uncorrected)g/Lg/L\n\nTemperature @2hr (C)CC\n\n2hr readng (corrected)g/Lg/L\n\n% Clay%%\n\n% Silt%%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarySample 1Sample 2\n\n% sand\n\n% clay\n\n% silt"

    "section": "8.1 INVESTIGATION A: Mineral Identification",
    "text": "8.1 INVESTIGATION A: Mineral Identification\nMinerals, even of the same type, can vary in color and physical properties making visual identification challenging. Some of the most common and important primary soil minerals are quartz, orthoclase (feldspar), micas (biotite and muscovite), apatite, and calcite, and amphiboles/pyroxenes. Common iron-containing soil minerals are goethite and hematite. Check each one off as you read the description and examine the specimen provided.\nPRIMARY MINERALS are formed from the original crystallization and solidification of magma). These minerals are present in igneous rocks and can be present in sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks if they survive the weathering process (sedimentary) or increased heat and pressure (metamorphic).\n□ Quartz is a framework silicate mineral (composed almost entirely of SiO2) that is very common in soils. It is fairly easy to recognize. It is usually colorless, transparent to translucent, and often is slightly “frosted.” It is generally spherical in shape but may appear as chips or flakes. Quartz is highly resistant to weathering, which accounts for its predominance in the sand fraction of most soils and as the major component of many sand beaches.\n□ Orthoclase (KAlSi3O8) is an important member of the Feldspar family. It is also known as potassium feldspar and is a good source of potassium in the soil. The Feldspars are also framework silicates and are more susceptible to weathering than quartz because they contain other elements in the framework (K, Ca, Na) besides Si that form less stable bonds with O. Feldspar color varies from pink to grey depending on elemental composition.\n□ Mica is an important primary phyllosilicate that is found primarily in two forms: biotite and muscovite. Biotite is dark brown to black iron-rich mica which is susceptible to weathering, while muscovite is generally colorless or lightly tinted. Note the iridescence. They both consist of thin flexible sheets that tend to separate into smaller sheets or flakes. Muscovite is named after the Principality of Moscow in Russia, where it is found in large sheets and was (believe it or not) used as a glass alternative in windows centuries ago.\n□ Apatite is actually the name of a group of calcium phosphate minerals that vary slightly in composition. Apatite is present at low concentrations in many igneous rocks and can also be formed as secondary minerals in sedimentary rocks. The most common form is fluorapatite, (Ca5PO4)3F. The color of apatite varies. As apatite weathers, it releases phosphorus and calcium into the soil. Large deposits are an important source of commercial phosphorus fertilizer.\n□ Amphiboles/Pyroxenes (Magnesium/Iron-rich Silicates) are examples of Magnesium and Iron-rich silicate minerals (present primarily in Basalt) that are usually highly susceptible to weathering and therefore only present as primary minerals in some soils. They tend to be dark in color, unlike quartz, feldspar and the phyllosilicates, which are grey to colorless.\nSECONDARY MINE RALS are formed in the process of weathering and transformation of primary minerals. They are present only in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.\n□ Illites, Vermiculite/Smectite, and Kaolinite are the other phyllosilicate groups that are not present in igneous rocks but are a major constituent of the clay fraction of soils. Illite is the term used for secondary micas found in the clay fraction of soils. Vermiculites and Smectites have shrink/swell properties and are formed from the weathering of micas and illites. Kaolinite is very stable and resistant to weathering (no isomorphous substitution, so no charge imbalance = a stable structure) and formed from the weathering of the other phyllosilicates.\n□ Calcite (CaCO3) occurs in limestone or similarly as dolomite (Ca,Mg)CO3 in sedimentary rocks (it can be precipitated from ocean water by organisms such as Foraminifera and corals). It can also be precipitated in arid regions where soil water containing ions and carbonates is drawn to the surface and evaporated, leaving carbonate salt residues. It often appears slightly chalky and white, whether as consolidated rock or as small nodules in the soils of dry regions. Their presence in soils can buffer soil pH from the effects of acid producing processes. Used as an amendment to raise pH.\n□ Goethite (FeOOH) (pronounced GUR-tite) is an oxidized iron mineral (iron oxide) that gives many Minnesota soils their brown color. In soils, it is found mostly as thin coatings on soil particles. Goethite is often a secondary mineral, meaning that it forms through the weathering of other primary minerals such as basalt. The example given is from a large geologic deposit of Goethite – we would never observe such a large accumulation of pure Goethite in soils.\n□ Hematite (Fe2O3) is another iron oxide mineral that gives other Minnesota soils a reddish color, especially those in northeast Minnesota. Hematite is the iron oxide mineral that made the Iron Range of Minnesota famous. Like goethite, it is found as thin coatings on soil particles. The example given is from a large geologic deposit of Hematite – we would never observe such a large accumulation of pure Hematite in soils."

Smaller rocks and particles are more susceptible to chemical weathering. Note that some sources of physical weathering can also be involved in chemical weathering.\n\nAbrasion: Water carrying suspended rock fragments has a scouring action on surfaces. Examples are the grinding action of glaciers, gravel, pebbles and boulders moved along and constantly abraded by fast-flowing streams. Particles carried by wind also have a “sand-blasting” effect.\nWetting and drying: Water penetrates into rocks and reacts with their constituent minerals resulting in recrystallization and increased stress. Wetting and drying is sometimes accompanied by shrinking and swelling, which also increasing internal stress.\nFreezing and thawing: When water is trapped in the rock (or in cracks) repeated freezing and thawing results in forces of expansion and contraction (when water freezes, its volume increases by about 9 %).\nHeating and cooling: Each different mineral in the rock will expand and contract by a different amount and at a different rate with surface-temperature fluctuations. With time, the stresses produced are sufficient to weaken the bonds along grain boundaries resulting in flaking off of rock fragments at the rock’s surface.\nUnloading/Exfoliation: Many rocks are formed at great depth under intense temperatures and pressures. As these rocks make their way to the surface and overlying rock is removed through erosion, some of the pressure is released. This release of pressure causes the rock to fracture horizontally. Cracks of this type increase in number as the rock reaches the surface.\n\nObserve the examples of physical weathering, then complete the table below.

This kind of weathering happens in arid environments where salts are present.\nHydrolysis: Water molecules at the rock’s mineral surface dissociate into H+ and OH– and the mobile H+ ions penetrate the rock’s crystal lattice. This creates a charge imbalance that causes cations (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+) to diffuse out.\nOxidation-Reduction: Several primary minerals contain Fe2+ and Mn2+. In an oxidizing environment, Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+. The change in oxidation state changes the size of the ion resulting in internal stresses and accelerated weathering. Reduced iron (Fe2+) is soluble and can be removed from the rock or mineral, while oxidized iron (Fe3+) is insoluble and remains in place.\nDissolution: Occurs when the component minerals of rocks are dissolved by water. The dissolved material is transported away leaving a space in the rock.\nAcidification: Dissolving of calcium carbonate (limestone) in acidic groundwater. One consequence of this process is the formation of caves in limestone areas.\n\nObserve the examples of chemical weathering then complete the table below.

PAY ATTENTION TO THE CLARITY OF THE LIQUID AT THE TOP OF EACH TUBE OF SLURRYS AFTER 5 MINUTES. High clarity indicates the absence of suspended clay particles, while cloudy liquid indicates that clay particles are still floating around in suspension and have not settled out.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\nIon\nWater Clarity\n\n\nDI-H20\nNone\n\n\n\nNaCl\nNa+\n\n\n\nAlCl3\nAl3+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpret the results of Investigation D based on what you know about the charge on clays and the ionic potential of cations. What accounts for the differences observed? Hint: Look at the lecture slides on clay mineralogy. The answer has to do with the charge on clay particles and the strength of the charge on the cation in solution."

Label one “Kaolinite” and the other “Smectite”.\nPlace a teaspoon of Wyoming bentonite in the “Smectite” cup (WY Bentonite is a type of smectite often used in engineering applications) and a teaspoon of Kaolinite in the “Kaolinite” cup.\nUsing the graduated cylinder, add 20 ml of distilled H2O to each cup and stir with the pencil provided. (If the clay is not saturated, continue to add water in 10 ml increments and stir until you see excess water on the bottom).\n\nDescribe what happens to each of the clays. How much water (ml) could you add to each before there was excess water?\n     \nExplain this below using what you know about the properties of the major clay mineral groups and the difference between Kaolinites and Smectites."

Both soils have a clay percentage greater than 35%. Unlike the Kaolinite and Smectite clays in Investigation E, which are from mined geological deposits, these are real soil materials (dominated by each of these different clay types) and so they have color associated with them which is not due to the clay minerals alone.\nNote the wetted and dried samples of each and describe what you see in terms of its behavior.
